On July 11th new guidelines for a more inclusive language were merged into Linus Torvald's kernel tree.

This is a sign of the times, where in the light of the Black Lives Matter movement, more and more organizations
are reviewing their policies around language, that could be perceived as offensive.

There's an ongoing debate, if those changes are really necessary in all cases, but the tide is turning into a
direction where you're getting perceived as insensitive when you insist on continued use of words such as blacklist.

On a personal note, I never used to think about white people when encountering the term whitelist,
nor did I think of any kind of people when I used the term blacklist. The same way a white or
black colored car isn't associated with any kind of people for me. Ironically this has changed recently,
because of the very discussion about those words. Now everytime I'm confronted with them, I'll have to think
about the debate that is surrounding them, and hence I'll indirectly be thinking about people relationships.

Yet, as I followed the discussions surrounding the possible offense that could be taken by the words whitelist and blacklist,
two things became clear to me:

1) If people are offended by a term, and there's an equally good alternative term, then it will just be a distraction from the quality of my code and projects, when I keep using the term that is considered offensive to some, even if I meant no harm by using it.
2) When I don't take part in the formulation of alternative terms, others will decide them for me.
3) Some of the suggested alternatives up to this point have a inferior ring to them compared to the words they are replacing.

Number 3) is driving me to create this repository and to make my own suggestions for better replacements for words that have fallen out of favor.

To me black is one of the coolest sounding words in the English language, and white is also a better sounding than your average word,
and I strongly believe that the beauty of sounds factors strongly into the development of human language, slang and technical terms,
it's not just about making technical sense, it's also about sounding right and in the best case cool or beautiful.

One definitely inoffensive example of this is the expression being blue or having the blues. If someone is blue, that's a synonym for saying they are sad, melancholic or depressed.
But the word blue is clearly much more beautiful than the word sad is. Let's imagine for a the sake of argument that the word blue was becoming politically incorrect for some reason,
and that in that context the music genre blues would have to be renamed. It just wouldn't have the same feel to it, no matter which alternative you'd be choosing.
Would you call it "the sads"? An alternative would sooner or later definitely emerge, but my point here is the sound and feel of a word isn't as easily replaceable as some would have us believe.

The price of being politically correct shouldn't be to neuter language to the point of creating an Orwellian speech, where everything that
was formerly described as horrific henceforth gets described as double plus ungood.

So in this repository I want to collect and rate alternatives for those words that are falling out of favor.

Starting with the terms whitelist/blacklist:

Some of the first suggestions I came across were allowlist/denylist, perfect examples for words that make technical sense,
yet they're less than beautiful linguistically. Can you imagine a word like allowlist or denylist in musical lyrics?
Or in daily natural conversations?
"We put that on the denylist." That sentence can certainly be understood, but it feels like the constructed unnatural word that it is!

My suggestion:

Replace whitelist with greenlist. There's the expression to greenlight something/somebody, which essentially mean to allow somebody
or something to go forward. So greenlist is in line with existing English phrases and green is also universally used as a color indicating
that things are going good.

It was more difficult to find a good sounding replacement for blacklist, not in the least because black is one of the coolest
sounding words in the English language, so any replacement has to be worse almost by definition.

Here's a list of possibly good sounding replacements:
- blocklist
- dodgelist

Here's a list of replacements I don't like for some reason:
- redlist

Blocklist is very close to blacklist, and also has the meaning of to block something in it, so this seems like a good fit, however
I don't quiete like it too much, because it doesn't make a very appealing pair with greenlist for an inexplainable reason.

To dodge means to make a movement to avoid something. This is an apt description of what a blacklist helps to accomplish,
and I think it sounds better than redlist. Personally I like it better than blocklist, too.
Though both are better than denylist or rejectlist that were floating around as possible replacements.
